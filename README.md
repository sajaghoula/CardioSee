# Interactive Cardiac Segmentation & Clinical Data Platform

This repository contains the code and resources for the Master’s Thesis project developed at CiTIUS under the supervision of Marta Núñez García. The project focuses on computer vision for cardiac image segmentation and interactive analysis of clinical data, integrating both into a web-based platform.


## Project Overview
The platform is designed to enable dynamic exploration of medical imaging data and clinical variables. It combines:

- **Computer Vision:** Segmentation of heart structures, epicardial fat, and other anatomical components from CT scans. Includes preprocessing, reorientation, and 3D reconstruction.
- **Clinical Data Integration:** Visualization of structured patient data (demographics, plasma, histology) alongside imaging data.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Web-based platform built with Flask (backend), Modern Web Technologies (frontend), and Firebase for data management.
- **End-to-End Workflow:** From data preprocessing and image segmentation to interactive visualization for research and clinical insights.


## Features

- Cardiac CT segmentation pipeline (heart, epicardial fat, anatomical structures)
- 3D reconstruction and interactive visualization of segmented images
- Integration of imaging data with structured clinical datasets
- Dynamic plots and exploration of clinical variables
- Modular architecture for scalability and maintainability



## Dataset

- Real clinical dataset from Hospital Clínico Universitario de Santiago (CHUS)
- Includes CT imaging data, demographics, plasma, and histology data for over 100 patients
- Fully anonymized in compliance with data privacy regulations


## Technologies Used

- Programming: Python
